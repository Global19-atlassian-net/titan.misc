# titan.misc

This repo is intended to collect TTCN-3 based applications, demo and instructional code etc.

VSBOT is a Vulnerability Scanner Based On TTCN-3. Currently scans for web application vulnerabilities, namely directory traversal, SQL injection and XSS; it is not necessarily meant for industrial usage, it's rather a prototype that can constitute a good starting point to build your own vulnerability scanning application.
The execution is based on TTCN-3 executed by Titan, with number of building blocks from the Titan toolbox(test ports etc.)  and it also has a Python-based GUI.
